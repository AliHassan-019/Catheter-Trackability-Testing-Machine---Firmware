## üìù Overview

The Catheter Trackability Testing Machine Firmware is a comprehensive, open-source embedded software solution designed to automate and standardize the measurement of catheter trackability in medical device testing. Trackability is a critical performance metric for catheters, reflecting their ability to navigate through tortuous anatomical pathways. This firmware enables precise, repeatable, and safe testing by integrating advanced hardware control, real-time monitoring, and user-friendly interfaces.

Developed for research laboratories, medical device manufacturers, and academic institutions, the firmware supports both manual and automatic operation modes. It provides granular control over all test parameters, ensures accurate data acquisition, and facilitates compliance with regulatory standards. The system is built to be extensible, allowing future enhancements such as wireless monitoring and AI-based analysis.

|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Manual**   | - **Stepper Motor Control:** Move the catheter forward or backward incrementally for fine positioning.<br>- **Heater Control:** Manually activate or deactivate the heater rod to maintain the test environment temperature.<br>- **Gripper Control:** Open or close the pneumatic gripper for secure catheter handling.<br>- **Homing Sequence:** Return all moving components to their safe home positions to prevent mechanical errors. |
| **Automatic**| - **Motor Speed Setting:** Define the catheter insertion/extraction speed in mm/sec for consistent testing.<br>- **Temperature Tracking:** Monitor and regulate the heater rod temperature in real-time, displayed on the HMI.<br>- **Kink Force Threshold:** Set a force limit (in Newtons) to detect catheter kinking and trigger automatic ejection.<br>- **Insertion Length:** Specify the total insertion length in mm for automated cycles.<br>- **Automatic Ejection:** System automatically ejects the catheter if a kink is detected, ensuring sample safety and repeatability. |

## üîÑ System Workflow

The firmware manages the entire catheter testing process through a well-defined sequence of operations, ensuring safety, accuracy, and repeatability. Below is a detailed breakdown of the workflow:

1. **Homing:** All moving components (motor, gripper) are returned to their home positions using limit switches to ensure a known, safe starting state.
2. **Temperature Check:** The system reads the heater rod temperature and verifies it is within the required range for testing. If not, the heater is activated.
3. **Heating:** The heater rod is controlled to reach and maintain the target temperature, monitored continuously via sensors.
4. **Catheter Movement:** The stepper motor drives the catheter according to user-defined parameters (speed, length), with real-time feedback.
5. **Force & Temperature Monitoring:** The load cell measures insertion/extraction force, while temperature is tracked throughout the test. Data is displayed on the HMI and logged for analysis.
6. **Sample Insertion/Extraction Cycle:** The system performs the full test cycle, moving the catheter in and out as specified.
7. **Automatic Ejection on Kink Detection:** If the measured force exceeds the kink threshold, the firmware triggers the pneumatic gripper to eject the catheter automatically, preventing damage.
8. **Return to Homing:** After test completion or ejection, all components return to their home positions, ready for the next cycle.

## üß© Firmware Architecture

The firmware is architected for reliability, modularity, and extensibility. Each subsystem is managed independently, with robust communication protocols ensuring seamless integration:

- **Control Logic:** Implements real-time control algorithms for the stepper motor, heater rod, pneumatic gripper, and limit switches. Ensures precise execution of test cycles, safety interlocks, and error handling.
- **HMI Interaction:** The 7-inch DWIN LCD touchscreen provides an intuitive interface for users to select operation modes, input test parameters, monitor live data (force, temperature, position), and receive alerts. The firmware manages all display updates and user inputs via UART communication.
- **Component Communication:** Utilizes UART for HMI, SPI for load cell driver, GPIO for motor, heater, gripper, and limit switches, and USB for camera integration. All data exchanges are validated for integrity and timing, ensuring reliable operation even under demanding test conditions.
- **Data Logging (future):** The architecture is designed to support future enhancements such as onboard data logging, wireless communication, and AI-based analysis modules.

## üöÄ Usage

The firmware supports two primary modes of operation, each tailored for different testing requirements. Below are detailed instructions for both modes:

### Manual Mode

Manual mode allows the operator to control each hardware component individually for setup, calibration, or troubleshooting. Typical use cases include positioning the catheter, verifying sensor operation, and preparing the system for automated tests.

**Steps:**
1. Power on the system and wait for the HMI to display the main menu.
2. Select "Manual Mode" on the touchscreen.
3. Use the HMI controls to:
	- Move the stepper motor forward or backward in small increments for precise catheter placement.
	- Activate or deactivate the heater rod to reach the desired temperature.
	- Open or close the pneumatic gripper to insert or remove the catheter.
	- Initiate the homing sequence to reset all moving parts to their safe positions.
4. Monitor live feedback (force, temperature, position) on the HMI.
5. Use the emergency stop button or HMI control in case of unexpected behavior.

**Example Command Snippets:**
```c
// Move motor forward
send_command("MOTOR_FORWARD");
// Activate heater
send_command("HEATER_ON");
// Open gripper
send_command("GRIPPER_OPEN");
```

### Automatic Mode

Automatic mode executes a full test cycle based on user-defined parameters, ensuring repeatability and compliance with test protocols.

**Steps:**
1. Power on the system and select "Automatic Mode" on the HMI.
2. Enter test parameters:
	- Motor speed (mm/sec)
	- Target temperature (¬∞C)
	- Kink force threshold (N)
	- Insertion length (mm)
3. Confirm settings and start the test.
4. The firmware will:
	- Perform homing and temperature checks automatically.
	- Control the stepper motor to insert/extract the catheter at the specified speed and length.
	- Monitor force and temperature in real-time, displaying data on the HMI.
	- Trigger automatic ejection if the force exceeds the kink threshold.
	- Log test results for review (future feature).
5. After completion, review the test summary on the HMI and prepare for the next cycle.

**Example Configuration:**
```json
{
  "motor_speed_mm_sec": 5,
  "temperature_C": 37,
  "kink_force_N": 2.5,
  "insertion_length_mm": 120
}
```
